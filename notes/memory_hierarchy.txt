[Locality]

Well-written computer programs tend to exhibit good locality.
That is, they tend to reference data items that are near other 
recently referenced data item, or that were recently referenced themselves.

This tendency, known as the principle of locality, is an enduring concept 
that has enormous impact on the design and performance of hardware and 
software systems.


Locality is typically described as having two distinct forms:
1. Temporal Locality 
2. Spatial Locality
