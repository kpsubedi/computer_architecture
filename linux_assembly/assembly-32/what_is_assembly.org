What is assembly language?

- Low-levle programming language
- communicate with processor
- specific to processor family
- An almost one-to-one correspondance with machine code

Only speak binary

10010001100101010101
10010001100101010101

We cannot speak binary language


Different Processors - Different Assembly Language
==================================================
- Intel
- ARM
- MIPS

Intel Architecture
==================
- IA-32
- IA-64


In this class we focus in IA-32 assembly.


Question?

1. Find CPU details on the Debain System
2. How do you know if you are a 32/64 bit CPU?
3. How do you know your CPUs additional capabilities such as FPU, MMX, SSE, SSE2, etc.




IA-32 Instruction Sets
======================
- General Purpose Instructions
- x87 FPU Instructions
- MMX / SSE/ SSE2 /SSE3 / SSE4 Instructions
- Other Instruction Set extensions


Programming in Assembly
=======================
- NASM + LD for assembling and linking 
- Executable in ELF format

NASM Documentation:
http://nasm.us/




Invoking System Call with 0x80
==============================
EAX = System call number
EBX = 1st argument
ECX = 2nd argument
EDX = 3rd argument
ESI = 4th argument
EDI = 5th argument


nasm -f elf32 -o helloworld.o helloworld.asm
ld -o helloworld helloworld.o
