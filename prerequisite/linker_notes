What do linkers and loaders do?

- Basic job of any linker or loader is simple: it binds more abstract names to more concrete names, 
which permits programmers to write code using the more abstract names.
- For example, it takes a name written by a programmer such as getline and binds it to
"the location 612 bytes from the beginning of the executable code in module iosys."
- it may take a more abstract numeric address such as "the location 450 bytes beyind 
the beginning of the static data for this module" and bind it to a numeric address".
